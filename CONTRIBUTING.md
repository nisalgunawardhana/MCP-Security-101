## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Can I contribute if I'm new to security?**
A: Yes! We welcome contributors at all levels. Start with documentation improvements or reviewing existing content.

**Q: Do I need to be an MCP expert?**
A: While MCP knowledge is helpful, general security expertise combined with willingness to learn is sufficient.

**Q: Can I contribute anonymously?**
A: You can use a pseudonym, but we require some form of consistent identity for communication purposes.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Can I include Python examples?**
A: No, we focus on JavaScript examples only for consistency and educational clarity.

**Q: Can I submit theoretical vulnerabilities?**
A: Yes, but they should be well-researched and include practical implications.

**Q: How detailed should security examples be?**
A: Detailed enough to be educational but not so detailed as to enable actual attacks.

### Process Questions

**Q: How long does review take?**
A: Review typically takes 1-2 weeks depending on the complexity and scope of the contribution.

**Q: Can I work on multiple contributions simultaneously?**
A: Yes, but we recommend starting with smaller contributions to understand our process.
