### Implementation Strategies

#### Input Pattern Analysis
```javascript
// Example detection patterns (for reference only)
const INJECTION_PATTERNS = [
    /ignore\s+(previous|all)\s+instructions?/i,
    /act\s+as\s+(if\s+)?you\s+are/i,
    /pretend\s+(that\s+)?you\s+are/i,
    /system\s*:\s*/i,
    /assistant\s*:\s*/i,
    /\[INST\]|\[\/INST\]/i
];
```

#### Behavioral Monitoring
- Monitor for unusual tool invocation sequences
- Track rapid context changes within sessions
- Detect attempts to access restricted resources

### Detection Metrics
