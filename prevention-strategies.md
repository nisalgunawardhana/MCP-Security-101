## üöß 1. Prompt Injection Prevention

### Input Sanitization Techniques

#### Content Filtering
- **Instruction Keyword Filtering**: Block common injection commands
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain separation between user input and system instructions
- **Input Length Limits**: Restrict excessive input that could contain injection attempts

#### Implementation Strategy
```javascript
// Example sanitization approach (reference only)
function sanitizeUserInput(input) {
    // Remove potential instruction override attempts
    const dangerousPatterns = [
        /ignore\s+(previous|all)\s+instructions?/gi,
        /act\s+as\s+(if\s+)?you\s+are/gi,
        /system\s*:/gi,
        /assistant\s*:/gi
    ];
    
    let sanitized = input;
    dangerousPatterns.forEach(pattern => {
        sanitized = sanitized.replace(pattern, '[FILTERED]');
    });
    
    return sanitized;
}
```

### Context Isolation
- **Prompt Templates**: Use structured templates that separate user input
- **Role-Based Contexts**: Maintain distinct contexts for different user roles
- **System Instruction Protection**: Prevent user input from modifying system behavior

### Access Controls
- **Tool Restriction**: Limit available tools based on user context
- **Permission Validation**: Verify user permissions before tool execution
- **Session Isolation**: Prevent cross-session contamination

- **Hardware Tokens**: Use hardware-based authentication where possible
- **Backup Methods**: Provide secure backup authentication options

#### Token Management

- **Concurrent Session Limits**: Restrict simultaneous sessions per user

### Configuration Security
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic review of authentication configurations
- **Default Hardening**: Secure default settings for all components
- **Compliance Checking**: Automated validation against security standards

---

## üîí 5. Excessive Permissions Prevention

### Principle of Least Privilege

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Granular Permissions**: Define specific permissions for each operation
- **Role Definition**: Clear role boundaries with minimal required permissions
- **Regular Review**: Periodic assessment of role assignments

#### Just-in-Time Access
- **Temporary Permissions**: Grant elevated permissions only when needed
- **Time-Limited Access**: Automatic expiration of special permissions
- **Approval Workflows**: Require approval for elevated access requests

### Permission Management
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track actual permission utilization
- **Regular Cleanup**: Remove unused or excessive permissions
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive logs of permission changes

### Access Control Implementation
```javascript
// Example RBAC implementation pattern (reference only)
class PermissionManager {
    constructor() {
        this.roles = new Map();
        this.userRoles = new Map();
    }
    
    defineRole(roleName, permissions) {
        this.roles.set(roleName, new Set(permissions));
    }
    
    assignRole(userId, roleName) {
        if (!this.roles.has(roleName)) {
            throw new Error('Role does not exist');
        }
        this.userRoles.set(userId, roleName);
    }
    
    hasPermission(userId, permission) {
        const role = this.userRoles.get(userId);
        if (!role) return false;
        
        const permissions = this.roles.get(role);
        return permissions && permissions.has(permission);
    }
}
```
